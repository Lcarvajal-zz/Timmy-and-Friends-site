      <p>Quote: “I think what Timmy & Friends is doing is absolutely terrific. Especially in the current state of the world and the economy, people need to be more conscientious about connecting organizations. Organizations need to work together to help one another, to help make the world better together, and not compete for funding but instead support each other. In the end we all have one common goal: to give back. It is with the synergy that Timmy & Friends is creating that we are taking steps in the right direction. Thank you Timmy & Friends for thinking of Island Dolphin Care and for building something that is exemplary of this vision for a brighter future."</p>
